Frontend Performance Auditor MCP – AI-Optimized Description

Project Name: Frontend Performance Auditor MCP

Purpose:
Statically analyze frontend TypeScript/React code to detect performance anti-patterns in changed Git files, providing actionable, human-readable feedback before merging code.

Scope (MVP):

Detect INP risks: heavy loops inside event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)

Detect MEMORY risks: event listeners or intervals in useEffect without cleanup

Analyze only changed .ts/.tsx files via Git diff (e.g., main..HEAD)

Output Markdown reports with severity, file, line, explanation, and fix suggestion

Optional exit code 1 on high-severity issues for CI/merge-blocking

Core Workflow:

Git Diff Analysis: Extract changed files between two refs

AST Parsing: Use TypeScript Compiler API to parse files into AST

Rule Engine: Apply detection rules to AST nodes

Report Generation: Format findings in Markdown for CI, merge request comments, or console

CLI Example:

perf-mcp analyze --diff main..HEAD


Key Features for Cursor AI Understanding:

Rule-Based: Each rule has metric (INP or MEMORY), severity, explanation, and fix

Git-Aware: Operates purely via Git; platform-agnostic

Extensible: Easy to add new performance rules or metrics

Human-Friendly Output: Markdown with clear explanation per issue

Why It Matters:

Prevents frontend performance regressions before merge

Provides clear developer guidance automatically

Demonstrates AST-level static analysis + Git workflow integration
